        architectureHint: `
            The 5 architectural layers indicate in which context an IT professional works:
             <ul>
                 <li>User interaction: communication between (end) user and ICT system.</li>
                 <li>Organizational processes: facilitating organizational processes through ICT systems.</li>
                 <li>Infrastructure: the set of IT systems that facilitate organizational processes.</li>
                 <li>Software: developing various types of software that can be included in the IT infrastructure.</li>
                 <li>Hardware interfacing: software that interacts with available hardware.</li>
             </ul>
        `,

        activitiesHint: `
            The 5 activities are based on the 'system and software development life cycle':
             <ul>
                 <li>Analyzing processes, products and information flows in their mutual coherence and context</li>
                 <li>Advising on the design of processes and/or information for a new ICT system to be developed, purchased or adapted</li>
                 <li>Designing a (part of an) ICT system based on requirements</li>
                 <li>Realization and testing of (part of an) ICT system based on a design</li>
                 <li>Manage & control & optimize the development, deployment and use of ICT systems</li>
             </ul>
        `,

        levelsHint: `
            The level of mastery is determined by the complexity of the context, the complexity of the content and the independence in carrying out a professional task.
             <br />
             <br />
             To enable comparability within the diversity, we distinguish four control levels, in accordance with the definitions in the Zelcom model.
